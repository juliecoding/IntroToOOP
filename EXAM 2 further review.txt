Slide Set 3:

A template for all GUI programs
Dialogs (1 of 2):
    *Know when the function's body, apply, and validate are called.*

    The structure of a GUI program is always the same, so there is a template:
        from breezypythongui import EasyFrame
        #other imports, if relevant

        class ApplicationName(EasyFrame):
            The __init__ method definition
            Definitions of event handling methods

        def main():
            ApplicationName().mainloop()

        //main name statement at the bottom

You must override body and apply.
    The body method builds the dialog (like the constructor does with EasyFrame)
    The apply method is called if OK is clicked.

You can also override validate:
    If validate returns False, apply won't be called.

You can call .setModified() and .modified()
    A "signal" to the rest of your program.
