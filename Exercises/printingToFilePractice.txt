Conditionally running things, so your imports don't get crazy.
if __name__ == "__main__":
main() #wrap your "don't want everyone to run this" code in a function called main.
Recursion
Truthiness vs. Falsiness
FALSY VALUES: 0, empty string, empty container, None, False
Memory shape
Code
Data
Heap
Stack: for function calls

Jan 13
Recursion as applied to square roots and towers of Hanoi
Command-line arguments
sys.argv[0] = program name
sys.argv[1] = containers other parameters if any.

print('Program = ', sys.argv[0])
for arg in sys.argv[1:]:
print(arg)

Modules, functions, classes, and objects all constitute their own scope.

Higher-order functions: is a function that expects a function and a set of data values as arguments.
Examples in Python: .sorted
Mapping: applies a function to each value in a sequence and returns a map object
Predicate

Jan 22
def f(*stuff)
Any number of arguments, passed in as tuple

def f2(**stuff):
Do stuff and stuff.
Any number of arguments, treated as dictionary.
Example:
f2(a = 1, b = 'two', c = [3])

Functions are "first-class data objects" -- they can be arguments in functions.
HOF can expect other functions as argumnets and/or return functions as values.
Mapping function expects a funtion and a list of things to act on; returns Mapping Object ()
Predicate = function that returns a Boolean (used in filter)

join
strip (also lstrip, rstrip)
find, rfind,

substring
