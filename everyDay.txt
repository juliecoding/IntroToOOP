Conditionally running things, so your imports don't get crazy.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main() #wrap your "don't want everyone to run this" code in a function called main.
Recursion
Truthiness vs. Falsiness
    FALSY VALUES: 0, empty string, empty container, None, False
Memory shape
    Code
    Data
    Heap
    Stack: for function calls

Jan 13
Recursion as applied to square roots and towers of Hanoi
Command-line arguments
    sys.argv[0] = program name
    sys.argv[1] = containers other parameters if any.

print('Program = ', sys.argv[0])
for arg in sys.argv[1:]:
    print(arg)

Modules, functions, classes, and objects all constitute their own scope.

Jan 15
Higher-order functions: is a function that expects a function and a set of data values as arguments.
Examples in Python: .sorted
Mapping: applies a function to each value in a sequence and returns a map object
Predicate

Jan 22
def f(*stuff)
    Any number of arguments, passed in as tuple

def f2(**stuff):
    Do stuff and stuff.
    Any number of arguments, treated as dictionary.
    Example:
    f2(a = 1, b = 'two', c = [3])

Functions are "first-class data objects" -- they can be arguments in functions.
HOF can expect other functions as argumnets and/or return functions as values.
Mapping function expects a funtion and a list of things to act on; returns Mapping Object ()
Predicate = function that returns a Boolean (used in filter)

POPULAR STRING METHODS IN Python
split
join
strip (also lstrip, rstrip)
find, rfind,
size,
substring

Object identity and structural equivalence
Programmers might need to see whether two variables refer to the EXACT SAME object or to DIFFERENT objects
For example, you might want to determine whether one variable is an alias for another
    The == operator returns True if the varaibles are aliases for the same object.
    Unfortunately, == also returns True if the CONTENTS of the objects are equal.
The first thing is called "object identity."
And the second is called "structural equivalence."

Use the keyword "is"
objA = [1, 2, 3]
objB = objA
objC = list(objA)

objB == objA #True
objC == objA #True

objB is objA #True
objC is objB #False

Feb. 5
Test has 25 questions, all multiple choice
It's on Feb 10 - Feb. 12

strings are immutable objects. They are a primitive type. In their most basic form, they are a (list) of characters.
list[0]
list[-1]

No questions about:
replace, map, filter

Definitely questions about:
Scope
Parameters
Definiing a main function (Module 1, part 8)
    if __name__ = "__main__":
        main()

List comprehensions (see slide 2-53)
Truthiness
copying objects (`copy` keyword)
File I/O - what happens when you attempt to read from a file that doesn't exist.
What happens if you try to write to a file that doesn't exist (it creates it).
What happens if you open a file for writing that DOES exist (it wipes the contents and puts your cursor at the top).
SORTING BY AN EMBEDDED KEEEEY (like when we got the tuples back) - Module 1, slide 29.
def by_count_word(pari):
eturn(pari[1], pair[0])

sorted( key=by_count_word)

NOTE for Julie: You can reference a global variable in a function; you just can't change it.
so print(count) inside a function is A-OK, even if count is global.
But count = count + 1 throws an error (exception?).

Make sure you know how to supply  what a base case

GUI stuff (read book)
Classes and constructors in Python.
A constructor in python looks like:

def __init__(self):


Objects go on the heap, which is why you need self as the first parameter in any class method definition.
It's to identify the object in memory.

What is an instance in Python?
What is an instance variable?


------------------------
Wed. Feb 24
You will need to
self.outputArea.setText(br.report())

fList = [("Text Files", "*.txt")]
filename = tkinter.filedialog.askopenfilename(parent=self, filetypes = flist)

Dialog Boxes are popup windows that go away when you are finished with them.

You must OVERRIDE body and apply
The body methods builds the dialog.
The apply method is called if OK is clicked.


1. Inherit from EasyDialog
2. Have your new dialog's __init__ call EasyDialog's __init__
3. def body(self, parent): add components.
4. def validate
5. apply
^NOt a complete list. Check the Slide before "Common Dialogs from the tkinter.messagebox module" slide.
Body is the function where you add components to your dialog.
Apply is where you extract data from dialog

You can add widgets to dialog boxes just as you can with Easy Frame objects (except you use the body method instead of __init__)

You can also override validate:
If you return False, apply won't be called.

You can call .setModified() and .modified()
A signal to your main GUI logic.

***

Modify the friends and recommend function so that they take a variable number of friends to recommend for. Did that make sense?

friends(name, nfriends = 2)

Go learn what "bind" is in terms of "mouse and keyboard events that can be associated wtih Handler methods for window objects (bind)."

------------------------
Wed. Feb 26
Class definition contains:
* Definitions of all of the methods that its objects recognize
* Descriptions of the data structures used to maintain the state of the object

INSTANCE VARIABLES start with self.

accessors = getters
mutators = setters

--------------------------

Computer Science Notes 3/2/2020
Project review –
    • We need to update the original bookRecs code to be able to
    use multiple friends
        o Add a second variable passed into the friends function
        called “nfriend = 2”
        o Every time you use 2 in the friends function, replace
        it with “nfriend”
        o Update the recommend function where you call the
        friends function to pass nfriends into the function,
        as well as the variable you’re already passing.
Notes – Module 4
    • Rational Numbers
        o Consist of two integer parts, a numerator and a
        denominator (fractions!)
        o Python has no built-in type for rational numbers
            ▪ We need to build a new class (named “Rational”)
            ▪ See Slide 18 of Module 4
    • Equality and the _eq_ Method
        o Not all objects are comparable using < or >, but any
        two objects can be compared for == or !=
        o See Slide 22
    • Class Variables
        o Belong to the class, not the object
            ▪ Called “static” variables
        o There are also static methods
            ▪ Static methods have NO self

NOTES ON COFFEE MACHINE
CoffeeMachine = the "user interface"
Accepts money
Presents different beverage selections


In the machine there is


My questions:
Which things are is-a?
Which things are has-a?


Selector has to know what the cashbox is, and it needs to be able to make function calls for the



CoffeeMachine and Selector share one CashBox
this.selector.cashBox

haveYou method = do you have enough money

Ways to make it FANCIER
* Daily collected/totaled
* Cancel button

You have to pass CoffeeMachine's Cashbox into CoffeeMachine's selector:
    class CoffeeMachine {
        cashBox = CashBox(self)
        selector = (self, self.cashBox) #not sure if this is correct syntax, but it's correct idea
    }

WARNING:
Do not allow user to put in pennies or anything that is not half-dollars, quarters, dimes and nickles

Product's make function is the one that spits out "Dispensing milk" or "Dispensing sugar"

OOP Basics

Data encapsulation: restricting manipulation of an object's state by external users to a set of method calls (classes)

Inheritance: Allowing a class to automatically reuse/extend code of similar but more general classes (like we did with EasyFrame)

Polymorphism: Allowing several related classes to use the same general method names
    - But allow for variation in implementation!
    e.g., Duck and Dog can extend base class Animal. Animal class can have a speak method that the subclasses implement


PYTHON's syntax doesn't enforce data encapsulation
    But classes allow us to group data and methods together
Inheritance and polymorphism are built into Python


Approximating Privacy
*Classes allow you to define both _data_ and _methods_ for that data
*User should primarily use a class's methods
*We can use weird underscores to approximate privacy. E.g.:
    class PrivateExample:
        def __init__(self):
            self.__myHiddenVal = 1
            self.myPublicVal = 2
    p = PrivateExample()
    p.myPublicVal
    # p.__myHiddenVal #will throw AttributeError
    p._PrivateExample__myHiddenVal


In Python all classes automatically extend the built-in object class
It is possible to exand any existing class like so:
class <new class name> (<Name of class it's extending>)

To call a method in the parent class from within a method with teh same name in a sublcass:
<parent class name>.<method name>(self, <other arguments>)

UML diagram notes:
Empty diamond = has a??
Empty arrow = is a??

Shapes as classes (slides show it)


---------------------

Abstract classes are a thing
Import ABC and use decorators on abstract methods.

------------------------------------------------

Lists in Python are sequences of pointers
    Each pointer refers to an object elsewhere in memory.
    This is how Python supports lists with mixed types of entrieds

Real ARRAYS don't do this.
    They store the values (not pointers) contiguously in memory
        But in python they can only store numeric values(
            bool, int, float
        )

    For arrays...

    Arrays use much less memory.



    Basic types for array (b = btye)
----------
    Array supports most list operations, but not clear, copy, or sort.

    numpy.ndarray
        The add-on module numpy has support for mathematical array processing and data analysis.
    It has an even _better_ array type: ndarray
        You can operate on it all at once instead of only element-by-element.
        Makes multi-dimensional arrays easy to use.


Common numpy.ndarray Types
TypeCode  | Meaning
'?'       | bool
'b'       | byte
''        | int
''        | float
''        | complex

Arrays have to be filled with all of the same type.


WHEN TIME FOR QUESTIONS
I don't understand setting the data type to byte. What if you have elements that can't be stored in a single byte? NOTE: maybe this is why they can't hold strings??
Do all elements in the ndarray have to have the same number of elements themselves? Allowed or not? [ [1], [2, 3]]
I still don't understand what array "shape" means?


Slices of ndarrays don't make copies
Use .copy() to make a copy
    No need for a deep copy.

TOOLS TO USE WITH ndarray

linspace: Creates an evenly spaced array of numbers
loadtxt: Reading numbers from a text file: this is easy to do with numpy's `loadtxt` method. It reads numbers in from a text file.

A different module: the matplotlib

PROCESSES AND THREADS AND OTHER JOYS
What is a process?
    A program in execution.
    The computer loads executable code into * main memory * and starts it by executing its first machine-language instruction.
    Processes are independent of each other. They * don't share * memory.

What's inside a process?
------------------
Blank space on top        MmHighestUserAddress

Dynamic DLLs
Env vars
PEB

Process Heap (everything needed at runtime: memory for code, varibles, stack frames for function calls)

Thread 1 Stack
Thread 2 Stack

Mapped file(s) & Application data

Executable
------------------

Python Processes
Python is the program running in memory.
It is _not_ your code.
Python interprets your code.

Source code -> interpreter -> running code
See^, the Python interpreter is the running process.


An Inside Look
Source Code --> BEGIN INTERPRETER BOX Compiler --> Byte code --> Virtual machine END INTERPRETER BOX --> Running code
                                                                    ^\-Library modules


Launching Other Processes from Python
You can launch any executable with the subprocess module
    Your process waits until it finishes (no parallelism)
You can launch another Python process with the multiprocessing module.
    You pass it a function to start executing its new process.
    It runs concurrently with your Python process.
        It is a separate entity as far as the operating system (Windows/Mac OS/Linux) is concerned.
        If your machine has multiple CPUs/cores, it runs simultaneously with your process.
    You can wait for it, or not.


The `subprocess` Module
The output of the launched process will appear as output in your process.
Or, you can receive the input into your process and do what you want with it.

See process1.py (Mac and Windows)


The `multiprocess` Module
The launched processes run * independently * of your process.
    And runs * simultaneously * with your process.

Compare findprimes.py and findprimes2.py


Launching Processes Manually - See multiproc1.py
multiprocessing.Process
    You pass it a function to executable
        Either a lambda or function defined at module level
    Typical launch overhead: Java: 500ms, Python: 150ms, Go: 50ms

    Process.start:
        launches the process
    Process.join:
        waits for the process to complete


CONCURRENCY
    A program can have many tasks
    Some tasks may be separable
        Meaning one does not have to wait for the other to finish
        They could run concurrently
    Web servers do this
        Every request is handled separately from other requests.

    Concurrency is a way to organize tasks
        Even if your computer has only one CPU (or "core")
        If only one machine instruction can run at a time on our computer, you can still keep tasks "logically separate" in how you run them via threads

    Parallelism = Concurrency + Simultaneous Execution
        Tasks running on separate CPUs/cores at the same time


Concurrency vs. Parallelism
    Quote from Rob Pike, Co-inventor of Go:

    "Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once.
    Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.
    Not the same, but related.
    One is about structure, one is about execution.
    Concurrency provides a way to structure a solution to solve a problem that may (but not necessarily) be parallelizable"


Concurrency on a Single Processor              See findprimes3.py
    Accomplished through threads.
        A thread is a * separate path of execution * in a single, running program.
    The computer's OS gives each thread a * "time slice" *
    Then it rotates through all the threads, giving each a time slice
        Can give the appearance of parallelism to the human observer
    Each thread has its own "context"
        So it can pick up where it left off when it was previously interrupted by the O/S


I/O-bound vs. CPU-bound Operations and the GIL
    Python has a Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)
        Only * one thread * is allowed to run at a time.
    What?!?
        Why have threads if they always have to take turns?
    Answer #1: They are good for designing separable tasks
    Answer #2: They are fine for I/O-bound tasks:
        Input and output operations always do some waiting anyway (because storage and network connections are slower than main memory)
        When a thread is doing input or output it's "blocked", so Python interleaves its execution with other threads, allowing other threads to have a turn while the I/O thread is waiting.
    If your program is mainly using the CPU instead of doing I/O, then threads slow things down
        Hence the need for multiple processes running simultaneously


Blocking Operations                         See iobound.py -- could not find in class files
    Threads sometimes sit idle. They "block", waiting ...
        For user input (humans are slow)
        For an I/O task to complete
        For a sleep cycle to expire
        For a complex computation

    But modern computers have multiple processors/cores
        hence the push for parallelism
        to keep the processors busy as much as possible
        to speed up throughput


Producer-Consumer Execution Model                   See prodcons.py, prodcons1.py, prodcons2.py
    A common scenario that shows how threads/processes can communicate
    Typically use special queues
        Producers insert data into the queue
        Consumers remove data from the queue

    There can be many producers and consumers simultaneously

    take_order ----> prep_order ----> serve_order
                q1               q2
